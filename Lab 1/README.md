## Task 1: Printing Prime Numbers
Write a Java method to compute and print the list of prime numbers less than a given parameter. The method signature should be as follows:
<pre>
    void PrintPrimes (int max)
</pre>

## Task 2: Computing Fibonacci Numbers
Write a Java method to compute and return the Nth Fibonacci number, which is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the preceding two. The method signature should be as follows:
<pre>
    int computeFibonacci (int n)
</pre>
